For example, if you shoot to a missile in the right hand side of the landscape, the system made the rightmost cannon shoot. The original systems took care of the case in which a cannon has no missiles loaded: if a cannon is empty, you must shoot from the nearest of the ones with loaded missiles."

You have to use firedToOuterThird(priority1, priority2, priority3), that, given the priorities, returns the loaded cannon with highest priority, and firedtoMiddleThird(priority1, priority2), that makes the same thing, but for only two cannons. I know that it difficult Drogo, but you can do it, we can do it: we can win this war, together."
