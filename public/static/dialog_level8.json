I suggest you to create a function, call it whenever you like, and then invoke it at precise intervals with setInterval. Second, what this function must do? It should be just a loop that shoot a certain number of missiles (I think 18 are enough) at precise positions. If you forgot it, the easiest way to shoot is playerShoot(x,y).

You can obtain this easily from CANVAS_WIDTH. firedToOuterThird is useful when you want to shoot in the leftmost or in the rightmost third, same function but inverted priorities. When you shoot to the second third, the central, use always the central cannon, until it has missiles. Then you can divide the landscape in two sides and use firedtoMiddleThird."
